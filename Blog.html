                <p>Brief introduction to quantum cryptography. This was written for my Quantum Mechanics 2 course. I had taken Cryptography and Cryptanalysis the semester before and was at the time sitting in on Introduction to Hardware & Algorithms of Quantum Computing. This paper was kind of a breeze because I picked a topic that I was already well-versed in and did a very shallow overview.</p>

            <p>This was written for a special topics in physics course I took, called Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage. Initially the class was almost all in lab work. I was to build different supercapacitors that would be used as part of a larger experiment. Unfortunately due to Covid the class switched to remote learning about halfway through the semester. I never finished making the capacitors. This presentation was given to the other students in the class who were focusing on other materials.</p>

            <p>I wrote this as the final paper for an english 1012 class I had to take as part of the gen ed requirements at Brooklyn College. I got to pick the topic which was nice!</p>
